dialogue ideas


//so, a blackboard? 

//content pipeline - write everything in code or like, have text documents loaded via some API?

//then it would be cool to have some simple tool generate syntax like 
//name of conversation, character speaking, their lines, list of possible responses

//like if idk, Deborah knows that you plan to blow up a storage unit outside Tauos III, 
// she will talk about that, instead of talking about other stuff like what are you doing here

//valve approach
//the higher the number of criteria for any given rule -> the more specific it is, 
// therefore if you have to pick from a series of possible rules, pick the one with the most
// criteria in it

//characters can send events to each other, containing some information, using some kind of premise
//fullfilling - one character stops speaking, sends an event to another character, that character is speaking

//or i could have a "conversation" object, which can contain characters, and if a character is present
//in a conversation (would just be a comm channel, so this is easy to tell), they receive all the information
//shared there and add it to their own database of facts


//it would be cool to have a way for characters to terminate their speech or break out of a long
//monologue, if for example, you decide you wanna kill them and fire a volley at their ship,
