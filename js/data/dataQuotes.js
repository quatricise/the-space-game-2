    authorRef: "bigT",
    text: "There exist many things I could use to define myself by, but they're external. I am but a lonely island drifting uncontrollably through the matrix of events, occasionally meeting other lonely islands and waving at them."

Most times you will find it isn't, but you have nothing better to do."
