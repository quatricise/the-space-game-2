  factions: {
    the_crimson_league: `
      One of the x major factions. Mostly opposed to the current rule of the <ruling class>. They are heavily armed, skilled combatants and pilots, but they have their own
      political ideology mostly derived from the old earth's communism. Their culture is perhaps not as rich and not as important as for many other factions, but they aren't
      just warriors and reformators. Strong communal spirit, private life is kept to a minimum.
    `,
    the_crown: `
      The current ruling faction in subsector [1,6]. The state is mostly a typical institutional monarchy, with the upper classes holding the majority of power. Members of the
      parliament vote the next ruler and pass laws into legislation. 
      Mostly loyal.
      The crown houses some of the best trained military personnel, elite fighters and arguable the most advanced aircraft.
    `,
    the_hive: `
      (TEMPORARY NAME) A highly advanced AI society, also controlling it's own fleet of spaceships. Their motives are mysterious, they are mostly architects and collectors,
      but they get up to some shady business from time to time.
      Nobody outside of the hive understands their language, but they default to standard interstellar english ( SIE ) when they communicate with outsiders."
    `, 
    alliance: `
      The mostly passive but politically very active group. Has major support in one part of the [1,6] subsystem. Has their own fleet, with very well trained personnel.
      Basically modern-day democracy, with it's usual flaws. (so far pretty boring). They wanna keep the economic system of oppression, but want to introduce democracy based
      on electoral college, to which members are voted from the self-governing territories.
    `,
    colonists: `
      Collective term for all population not directly affiliated or under the rule of the Crown, they either reject the Crown or aren't interested in their politics. 
      As they do not have any centralized communication system, it is not possible
      to lose or gain reputation with all colonists as the result of any action taken on any local system. As such, you can be a total asshole. Befriending
      colonists will not bring you much advantage, due to their unorganized nature and insignificant numbers of military equipment and skilled fighters.
      Dismissing them completely, however, may cause more trouble than any one ship could handle. Their orbital defences are powerful and well-kept.
    `,
    traders_union: `
      (TEMPORARY NAME) A loosely organized society of traders. Without owning or controlling any major settlements, 
      their base of operations is a large space-station orbiting Tauri B
      Has deep connections to almost every faction. There are self-sufficient colonies and systems, but they
      are far and few between. The handful of individuals at the helm of the union hold immense power, more than most leaders are willing to admit.

  locations: {
    tauri_b: `
    A terrestrial planet in a regular G-type main-sequence star system. Home to the Traders Union base of operations, orbiting the planet.

  lexicon: {
    ultra_port: `
      A system of connected beacons that form super-highways throughout the more advanced systems in the Draco II subsector [1,6]
      The system allows ships to travel quickly between destinations and require no piloting during the guided travel, as automated systems
      take over control of the ship. The crew spend their journey in cryo-fugue.
    `,
    cryofugue: `
      Short term for "cryogenic fugue", a type of device that freezes your body safely, used for long-distance interstellar travel.
    `,
    hive: `
      A physical "sphere" used as a host to artificial life. Usually orbiting planets or moons. Each is usually home to many artificial entities, all in close contant with each other.
    `,
    SIE: `
      Standard Interstellar English. The universal language if you want to get around any place. 
      It is by law taught in all schools under the rule of the Crown, alongside the local languages in each system.
