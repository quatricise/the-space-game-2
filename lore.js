  factions: {
    the_crimson_league: `
      One of the x major factions. Mostly opposed to the current rule of the Crown. They are heavily armed, skilled combatants and pilots, but they have their own
      political ideology mostly derived from the old earth's communism. Their culture is perhaps not as rich and not as important as for many other factions, but they aren't
      just warriors and reformators. Strong communal spirit, private life is kept to a minimum.

      Their fleet is much smaller than the Crown, or even the Alliance. They have a limited number of freighters and mostly rely on the Traders Union
    `,
    the_crown: `
      The current ruling faction in draco II. The state is mostly a typical institutional monarchy, with the upper classes holding the majority of power. Members of the
      parliament vote the next ruler and pass laws into legislation. 
      Mostly loyal.
      The crown houses some of the best trained military personnel, elite fighters and arguable the most advanced aircraft.
    `,
    the_five_batallions: `
      The crown's military consists of 5 distinct batallions (task forces or something), each with its mostly independent mode of operation.
      The five batallions function somewhat independently and make up the elite portion of the Crown's army. 
      They have their own emblems and coat of arms and are somewhat different in beliefs, culture, traditions and fighting styles.

      They are united in a tenuous alliance under the crown mostly due to immense financial backing from the court, 
      supplied from colonies and mining worlds, and outback systems that are exploited for their resources.

      Ships that look like ants, with open teeth at the front used to imitate ants and mount various weapons.

    `,
    the_hive: `
      (TEMPORARY NAME) A highly advanced AI society, also controlling it's own fleet of spaceships. Their motives are mysterious, they are mostly architects and collectors,
      but they do get up to some shady business from time to time. Stealing resources and equipment, kidnapping engineers.
      Nobody outside of the hive understands their language, but they default to standard interstellar english ( SIE ) when they communicate with outsiders.

      They're secretly working on a super-advanced battleship, that should be able to destroy entire fleets. However the project is going slow and the hive is faced
      with more suspicion as time goes on. There is a good chance they'll be busted.
    `, 
    alliance: `
      The less-militaristic than others, but politically active group. Has major support in a major cluster of systems known as the half-moon. 
      Has their own fleet, with very well trained personnel and high number of spacecraft.
      Basically modern-day democracy, with it's usual benefits and shortcomings. They wanna keep the economic system of oppression, but want to introduce democracy based
      on electoral college, to which members are voted from the self-governed territories.

      They don't have a secret plan for galaxy domination, they can become your allies, although you might want to shift slightly from your original mission goal.
      However, a single act of immoral or hostile behaviour and they might easily turn on you, their justice system is very strict with criminals. Life imprisonment
      for killing of any kind. (it is of course more complex than just this one rule)
      
      In general their sentiment is towards always doing the righteous/moral thing, no matter who you're dealing with.
    `,
    colonists: `
      Collective term for all population not directly affiliated or under the rule of the Crown, they either reject the Crown or aren't interested in their politics. 
      As they do not have any centralized communication system, it is not possible
      to lose or gain reputation with all colonists as the result of any action taken on any local system. As such, you can be a total asshole. Befriending
      colonists will not bring you much advantage, due to their unorganized nature and insignificant numbers of military equipment and skilled fighters.

      Dismissing them completely, however, may cause more trouble than any one ship could handle. Their orbital defences are powerful and well-kept and some planets
      house up to at least several battle-cruisers.

      Amongst the colonies you may find many valuable allies. Some former high-ranking officials fled the confinement and anxiety of their position to lead a more free
      and relaxed lifestyle in the outback.
    `,
    traders_union: `
      A loosely organized society of traders. Without owning or controlling any major settlements, their base of operations is a large space-station orbiting Tauri B.
      Has deep connections to almost every faction. There are self-sufficient colonies and systems, but they
      are far and few between. The handful of individuals at the helm of the union hold immense power, more than most leaders are willing to admit.
    `,
    the_player: `
      You are an elite fighter of the Crown. Your job is to seek out the missing princess and get her safely back home, or report on her death.
    `,
    the_plot: `
      The princess has gone missing. After much investigation you find that she is mobilizing all factions opposed to the Crown, in an attempt to overthrow the current rule
      of her father. However you find out that there is a plan to screw over some of the factions involved and to use the revolution as a tool to set herself on the throne.
      You have the option to side with the King, the princess, Alliance or The Crimson League.

      Also, the traders union - they wanna own everyone through capitalism, basically.

      I think it should be possible to resolve most problems and do not lead to bloodshed. Like in undertale. You should be able to force ships to surrender by crippling
      the ships. But this sounds quite complicated for now.

  locations: {
    tauri_b: `
      A terrestrial planet in a regular G-type main-sequence star system. Home to the Traders Union base of operations, which orbits around the planet.
    `,
    world: `
      The world is set in Draco II galaxy. The self-proclaimed ruling faction is the Crown, which rules the surrounding star system clusters by force. Much opposition exists
      against their rule, but a state of ceasefire has persisted for decades now, with nobody able to contend the superior strenght of the Crown's fleet.

  lexicon: {
    ultra_port: `
      A system of connected beacons that form super-highways throughout the more advanced systems in Draco II. It consumes gigawatts of energy just to keep a single portal open.
      The system allows ships to travel quickly between destinations and require no piloting, as the jump is almost instanteneous, being carried through the VWB medium.

      Due to it's construction design, every ship translates out of VWB on each node in the system, therefore travel can be monitored by parties controlling
      any specific ultra-port node.
    `,
    portal: `
      A mechanical device that rematerializes ships travelling through VWB. Expensive to run, it consumes gigawatts of energy per second.
    `,
    beacon: `
      A type of device sending ripples through VWB. Can be detected by high-powered advanced sensors on larger ships.
    `,
    void_which_binds: `
      (VWB) Stolen concept from Dan Simmons. It's a medium that lies under reality, it allows for faster than light travel. It is often used to transfer messages across large distances. 
      The travel time is virtually instant for distances under 1 light-year.
    `,
    cryofugue: `
      Short term for "cryogenic fugue", a type of device that freezes your body safely, used for long-distance interstellar travel outside the ultra-port network.
    `,
    hive: `
      A physical "sphere" used as a host to artificial life. Usually orbiting planets or moons. Each is usually home to many artificial entities, all in close contant with each other.
    `,
    SIE: `
      Standard Interstellar English. The universal language if you want to get around any place. 
      It is by law taught in all schools under the rule of the Crown, alongside the local languages in each system.
      Some civilizations / colonies reject this decision and do not teach SIE. 
      It is impossible to speak to these people without a translator module on board or a specialist translator crewmember.
      Not all ships have a translator module, since processing language accurately takes a lot of resources and isn't often needed once throughout the ship's entire lifespan.
    `,
    outback: `
      A star system / location not connected to the ultra-port system of fast travel. Getting to outback systems requires following beacon signals. Their authenticity
      cannot be verified. Anyone can setup a location beacon and broadcast a signal through the VWB medium.
    `,
    FTL_drive: `
      Faster-than-light drive. The speed of FTL drives varies across ships. Larger, more powerful ships can reach speeds 10x the speed of light.
      During the journey automated systems usually take over control of the ship. The crew spend their journey in cryo-fugue.

      It is not ideal or sometimes possible for small ships to travel this way, as they do not have room to house the expansive cryo-fugue systems and often do not contain
      strong enough sensors to safely receive and decode the VWB ripples created by beacons.

  general: {
    skip: `
      A short distance jump a ship can make through the VWB medium. It consumes the ship's main energy reserves, the longer the skip, the more power it consumes.
      Any ship, while skipping, is invulnerable to damage, but it can still be detected by sensors, so your enemy usually knows where you are.
    `,
    jump: `
      Travel from one node to the next on the ultra-port system.
    `,
    translate_to_Cplus: `
      Reach FTL velocities, basically disappear from system and enter hyperspace. Translating is a slower alternative to ultra-port, but it is sometimes necessary, since
      some systems do not house ultra-port portals.
    `,
    currency: `
      Money speaks, and it speaks really loud. It should be possible to use money to influence the decision-making of a lot of NPCs. 
      Not everyone though and bribery can be met with hostility if you attempt it at the wrong time.
      Bribing can lead you to get valuable information, but also makes you seem less trustworthy and doesn't win true allies.

    ship_classes: `

      (small)

      || Drone class ||

      Unmanned small craft. Often deployed by cruisers as defensive satellites around them, blocking missiles. Some fighters may also dock one or two drones.
      They can technically travel by ultra-port, but that is strictly prohibited by virtually all territorial laws in an attempt to dissuade parties from engaging
      in automated combat, or anonymously harassing neighboring

      || Fighter class ||

      The fighter class is ideal for diplomatic missions, covert missions, surprise assaults or any fights where only a handful adversaries can be expected to show up.
      The small size and relative inexpensive nature of the craft is well suited for entering asteroid fields or exploring outback systems, where accidents and ambushes
      are more frequent.

      Fighters have no automated weapon systems, generally weak armor plating and shield strenght.

      || Scout class ||

      The smallest of all manned ship types. Usually armed with weak energy weapons. Often used for small diplomatic missions, location scouting, rescue missions.
      The cost of losing a scout is small, about the same as losing 100 mid-size apartment buildings, which is still bad, but nothing compared to planet-class battleships
      or even cruisers.

      (mid-size)

      Cruisers, cargo ships, battleships.

      || Cruiser class ||

      The cruiser is the all-round solution to all your problems. If you happen to have one at your disposal, that is. Well suited for most situations, except for fighting
      entire fleets or using it as sacrifice. The best cruisers can mount 4-6 weapons, all weapon types except for deathbeam.

      Cargo ships (small couriers, midsize carriers, large freighters)

      || Courier class || 

      Couriers are used to transport confidential messages and items, which cannot be legally transported along regular cargo. By design unarmed and fragile, except for the
      ship's black box which contains a trapped-blackhole auto-destruction module, guaranteed to destroy anything that was stored within it's containment field, if discovered without the proper
      authorization to enter the black box.

      || Freighter class || (midsize and large)

      This class of ship is bulky, sluggist, and without armament. However, it is often equipped with VWB sensors, powerful reactor and can transport multiple times the capacity
      of most other ships. It isn't viable for much else than cargo transport.

      Civilian ships (Small under-10 passenger civilian ships, midsize 10-300, planet class transporters 500-10000)

      || Civilian || 

      Civilian ships aren't used for much other than the transport of civilians, there aren't armed, have no or very weak shields. Not very important, but it's important
      to mention that they exist.

      (large)

      || Battleship class ||

      The pinacle of engineering, sporting the most advanced weapons and defence systems of the entire fleet. Usually only one or couple per task-force, 
      Territorial fleets, including the Crown's compound (5 divisions) fleet often keep only a handful of them in combat duty, due to the high cost of maintenance.

      They are often armed with a variety of weapon systems, manual and auto, laser, missile and shrapnell, often including deathbeam.

      For the player, the most important ships will be: fighter, cruiser, scout, battleship, cargo,

    looting_mechanic: ` (draft)

    Disabling a ship can be done in several ways:
    
      • Explode it. 

        Good if you have no other option. This scenario is often the result of delivering the fatal blow with a missile. 
        Exploding a ship can often leave not much of value left. Especially no electronic devices. Some raw materials can however be salvaged.
      
      • Cause a breach by damaging the ships hull, the crew will suffocate.

      • Kill the crew

      • Force to surrender by crippling the ship's defences/attack capabilities
    
      After disabling a ship you have several options what to do with it: 

      • Leave it there (idk why you'd want this)
      • Loot it for money, equipment and surviving crew members, (then optionally) send it to a repair station or scrapyard.
      • Send a towing service of any faction you decide to call, they'll tow the ship to their repair station and restore it for combat readiness, or scrap it for material.

      The decisions you make after destroying a ship can have pretty big consequences, be too greedy and you'll end up with a lot of extra useless cargo and loot. Also
      your allies might want to use those ships.
      Be too selfless and you'll soon run out of supplies and ammunition.

  weapon_types: {
    deathbeam: `
      Concentrated beam of microwaves, capable of scrambling proteins in living organisms. Requires insane amounts of energy to power and its AOE is small,
      but if aimed correctly, it can kill the entire crew, allowing you to loot the ship without damaging most equipment.
    `,
    missile: `
      Powerful with area attack damage. Uses missiles, which are space-inefficient, heavy, dangerous and expensive. 

      Most missiles are auto-guided "fire and forget".

      Very ineffective against laser-beam drones, since they can easily target and detonate a missile.
    `,
    energy: `
      Powered by ship reactor, rarely by cartridges or energy cells. Powerful enough to destroy most ships, but weak against shields.

      Types: Concentrated laser, continuous laser, plasma ball, 
    `,
    shrapnell: `
      Shoots many tiny metal pellets.
      Most useful against poorly armored, smaller craft. Can decimate a small scout/ fighter in a single well placed shot, as it tears through the cockpit and weaker plating.
